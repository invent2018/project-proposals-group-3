## Audience
People with limited photography knowledge

## Problems
What makes a good group or portrait photo? Maybe you know, but do your friends know? IS there uncertainty and dread when you ask them to help you take a photo only for them to botch it up completely? This app aims to be your perfect compainion to ideal group and portrait photo composition. 
## Solution
An application that instructs the user on how best to frame and expose the image. 

## Assumptions
People want aesthetic photos


## Unique Selling Point
Our app will focus group and portrait photos, but will look beyond framing, including lighting and exposure.

## Competitors
Camera 51 - they focus only on framing, and not focused on group/portrait photos
Photography 101 - Only has video courses on how to get better at photography but time inefficient and needs people to prepare before even taking the photo
Photography tutorials - Though has collection of photography articles and easy terms to understand, also requires people to read about them before taking the photo itself and guides the user less, not giving them feedback on their photo in real time - may not learn properly
Composition Cam - USers can choose their own overlay to compose their photos but users may not choose the best overlay for the photo they are taking. It also only focuses on framing and composition.
Photographer Free - Includes tutorials on how to shoot different subjects. Again, requires users to read up before taking the photo which is not time-efficient and cannot give real time feedback to the user
